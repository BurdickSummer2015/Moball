Welcome to the Caltech Guest wireless network
</p>

<p style="text-align:center">
Caltech is pleased to provide open access wireless service as a
convenience to our visitors while on campus. Caltech's campus-wide wireless networking system was made possible
through generous gifts from Aruba Networks, Inc., and from an alumnus
from Physics and Biology.
